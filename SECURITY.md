## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue with exploit details.**
2. Prefer using **GitHub Security Advisories** (private reporting), if available.
3. If private reporting is not available, open a GitHub issue with **minimal details** and clearly mark it as **SECURITY**.

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
- Steps to reproduce (safe / non-destructive if possible)
- Any logs or screenshots that help confirm the issue

## Coordinated disclosure

This repo aims to fix validated security issues quickly and transparently, but without publishing weaponized details before a patch exists.
