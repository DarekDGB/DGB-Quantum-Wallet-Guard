# QWG Documentation Index

This folder contains the official documentation for **Quantum Wallet Guard (QWG)**.

## Versions

- **v3 (current, authoritative)**  
  Glass-box contract, test-backed, and auditable.  
  → `v3/QWG_V3.md`

- **v2 (legacy / historical reference)**  
  Pre–glass-box documentation kept for context only.  
  → `v2/`

## Rule

Only **v3 documentation** reflects the current security guarantees.  
If something is not described in v3 **and enforced by tests**, it is not considered part of the active security model.
